# displacement-chapter-replication

This repository contains code to produce results and figures presented in our book chapter about incorporating processes of residential displacement into UrbanSim:

- Waddell, Paul & Samuel Maurer (forthcoming), "Integrating displacement into regional transportation and land use models," in _Transit-Oriented Displacement?  Understanding the Effects of Smarter Growth on Communities_, eds. Karen Chapple and Anastasia Loukaitou-Sideris, MIT Press.

## Setup

All the code is in Python, running in Jupyter notebooks. For clean setup, you can use an Anaconda virtual environment. (This is not required, it's just an easier way to install the dependencies and avoid version conflicts.)

1. Install the Anaconda Python distribution (https://www.anaconda.com/download/)

2. Install the environment specified in this repository:

`conda env create -f environment.yml`

3. Activate the environment:

`source activate displacement-chapter-replication` (Mac or Linux)  
or, `activate displacement-chapter-replication` (Windows)

4. Launch Jupyter
