### Setup

All the code is python running in Jupyter notebooks. For clean setup, you can use an Anaconda environment. (This is not required, it's just an easier way to install the dependencies and avoid version conflicts.)

`conda env create -f environment.yml`

Activate the environment:

`source activate displacement-chapter-replication` (Mac or Linux)

or
